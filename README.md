**Business Objective**
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

Threfore, the goal of this project is to build a predictive model to predict which customers are likely to churn and to identify the main indicators of churn.


**Definition of Churn**
There are various ways to define churn, such as:

Revenue-based churn: Customers who have not utilised any revenue-generating facilities such as mobile internet, outgoing calls, SMS etc. over a given period of time. One could also use aggregate metrics such as ‘customers who have generated less than INR 4 per month in total/average/median revenue’.

The main shortcoming of this definition is that there are customers who only receive calls/SMSes from their wage-earning counterparts, i.e. they don’t generate revenue but use the services. For example, many users in rural areas only receive calls from their wage-earning siblings in urban areas.

Usage-based churn: Customers who have not done any usage, either incoming or outgoing - in terms of calls, internet etc. over a period of time.

A potential shortcoming of this definition is that when the customer has stopped using the services for a while, it may be too late to take any corrective actions to retain them. For e.g., if you define churn based on a ‘two-months zero usage’ period, predicting churn could be useless since by that time the customer would have already switched to another operator.

In this project, we will use the usage-based definition to define churn.

**Conclusion**

Following are some recommendations to decrease the churn rate:

- Age on Network: Customers that have been with the Telecom for longer are less likely to leave. Therefore, plans and offers that incentivize long-term commitments could reduce odds of a customer churning.

- Number of times recharged: A drop in the typical number of times a customer recharges each month indicates that a customer may churn.An incentive should be provided such as free surprise coupons for each new recharge done to encourage customers to recharge more often; this mcan be offered specifically to customers that may churn.

- Drop in utilization: Customers should be monitored for a decrease in utilization of the top services seen above such as Local Incoming T2T etc. and a targeted offer should be made for the particular service where there is a drop to encourage its utilization.
